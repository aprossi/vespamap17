title: Why this workshop
subtitle: Background
class: big
build_lists: true

* Why this workshop (without EU jargon...)
    * Science needs with today's data wealth are different from 10 years ago
    * GIS/OGC and VO worlds need interoperability across (which is advanced withn each)

* Why this workshop (with some EU jargon...)
    * VESPA (Planetary VO) has its roots (IDIS) in EU FP6 (few years ago..)
    * FP7 saw a working prototype of Planetary VO
    * H2020 consolidated Planetary VO and expanded its mapping component

title: Why this workshop
subtitle: Objectives
class: big
build_lists: true

* Share and advance on Surface imaging and mapping (human, computer-aided, geologic, geospatial)
* Integrate data through OGC and VO standards: opportunities and challenges
* Disseminate information on available tools and datasets
* Improve VESPA mapping capabilities (search, discovery, etc.)
* Contribute to advance standardisation of mapping for small (irregular) bodies

title: A bit back in time
subtitle: A personal retrospective
class: big

* 1999: I saw my first planetary data (MGS)
    * Volumes were on CD (700 Mb)
    * Only tool was isis2 (python did not exist back then...), only on Sparc/Sun
    * GIS was rudimentary (but USGS was already ahead!)
* 18 years after planetary mapping is much changed
    * Overall size of community larger
    * Overall size/complexity of data extremely larger
* BigData or not, robust data access/analysis approaches are needed
* A bit like with Unix, VO/OGC are around since a while, evolve and provide (enough?) flexibility

title: Post workshop...
subtitle: What then?
class: big

* Well, we will see.
* Hopefully outcomes to positively influence
    * VESPA developments
    * Standardisation
    * Community awareness
    * Expansion of user base

title: Post workshop...
subtitle: Special issue
class: big

* We are working on a double special issue for 2 workshops:
    * 2017: Planetary Mapping and Virtual Observatory (EuroPlanet)
    * 2017: 3rd Planetary Data Workshop (USGS/LPI)
* Possibility of both technical/algorithm and scientific/analysis contribution (on 2 matching journals)
* Please fill the form online (links to be shared later during the workshop) indicating:
    a) Intention to submit a paper
    b) tentative title
    c) classification into more development/tools vs. data analysis/mapping
* For further questions, please get in touch with Angelo, Trent.
* More info to come in the next few weeks
